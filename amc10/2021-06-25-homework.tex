Consider the set of numbers $\{1, 10, 10^2, 10^3, \dots, 10^{10}\}$. The ratio of the largest element of the set to the sum of the other ten elements of the set is closest to which integer?

\fbox{(A) $1$ \quad (B) $9$ \quad (C) $10$ \quad (D) $11$ \quad (E) $101$}

\begin{answer}
The ratio is:
\begin{align*}
\frac{10^{10}}{10^{0}+10^{1}+\ldots+10^{8}+10^{9}}
\end{align*}
The denominator is a geometric sum with ten terms, which may be written in closed-form as
\begin{align*}
10^{0}+10^{1}+\ldots+10^{8}+10^{9}
= 
\frac{1-10^{10}}{1-10\hfill}
=
\frac{10^{10}(10^{-10}-1)}{-9}
=
\frac{10^{10}(1-10^{-10})}{9}
\end{align*}
Plugging this back into the original fraction and simplifying the $10^{10}$ term:
\begin{align*}
\frac{10^{10}}{10^{0}+10^{1}+\ldots+10^{8}+10^{9}}
=
\frac{9}{1-10^{-10}}
\approx
9
\end{align*}
where the $10^{-10}$ term is so small relative to $1$ that it may be neglected

For each positive integer $n$, the mean of the first $n$ terms of a sequence is $n$. What is the $2008^{\text{th}}$ term of the sequence?

\fbox{(A) $2008$ \quad (B) $4015$ \quad (C) $4016$ \quad (D) $4,030,056$ \quad (E) $4,032,064$}

\begin{answer}
Let $a_{n}$ denote the general term of the sequence and $S_{n}$ its sum:
\begin{align*}
S_{n} = a_{1} + a_{2} + a_{3} + \ldots a_{n}
\end{align*}
The mean of the first $n$ terms is equal to $n$, so:
\begin{align*}
\frac{S_{n}}{n} = n
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
S_{n} = n^2
\end{align*}
From the sums sequence we can recover the $a_{n}$ sequence as follows:
\begin{align*}
S_{n+1} - S_{n}
  = a_{n+1}
  = (n+1)^2 - n^2 
  = 2n + 1
\end{align*}
The general term is $a_{n+1}=2n+1$, so we get
\begin{align*}
a_{2008} 
  = 2 \times 2007 + 1 
  = 4015
\end{align*}
\begin{empheq}[box={\mathbox[colback=white]}]{equation*}

On Monday, Millie puts a quart of seeds, $25\%$ of which are millet, into a bird feeder. On each successive day she adds another quart of the same mix of seeds without removing any seeds that are left. Each day the birds eat only $25\%$ of the millet in the feeder, but they eat all of the other seeds. On which day, just after Millie has placed the seeds, will the birds find that more than half the seeds in the feeder are millet?

\fbox{(A) Tuesday (B) Wednesday (C) Thursday (D) Friday (E) Saturday}

\begin{answer}
Suppose the millet and the rest of the seeds weigh the same. Each day the amount added to the feeder weighs one unit (one quart). Let $m_{t}$ denote the amount of millet seeds in the bird feeder on day $t$, immediately after refill. Let $a_{t}$ denote the total amount of seeds in the bird feeder on day $t$, immediately after refill. 

The amount of millet seeds evolves according to:
\begin{align*}
m_{1} & = \sfrac{1}{4} \\
m_{2} & = \sfrac{1}{4} +     \left(\sfrac{3}{4}\right) \cdot \left(\sfrac{1}{4}\right) \\
m_{3} & = \sfrac{1}{4} + \left(\sfrac{3}{4}\right)^{2} \cdot \left(\sfrac{1}{4}\right) \\
m_{t} & = \sfrac{1}{4} + \left(\sfrac{3}{4}\right)^{t} \cdot \left(\sfrac{1}{4}\right) 
        = 0.25 + 0.25(0.75)^{t}
\end{align*}

The total amount of seeds (including millet seeds) evolves according to:
\begin{align*}
a_{1} & = 1 \\
a_{2} & = 1 + \left(\sfrac{3}{4}\right)     \cdot \left(\sfrac{1}{4}\right) \\
a_{3} & = 1 + \left(\sfrac{3}{4}\right)^{2} \cdot \left(\sfrac{1}{4}\right) \\
a_{t} & = 1 + \left(\sfrac{3}{4}\right)^{t} \cdot \left(\sfrac{1}{4}\right)
        = 1 + 0.25(0.75)^{t}
\end{align*}

The percentage of millet in the bird feeder immediately after refill must exceed $0.5$:
\begin{align*}
\frac{0.25 + 0.25(0.75)^{t}}{1 + 0.25(0.75)^{t}} 
                             & \geq 0.5 \\
                  (0.75)^{t} & \geq 0.25 \\
\left(\sfrac{3}{4}\right)^{t} & \geq \sfrac{1}{4} \\
\left(\sfrac{4}{3}\right)^{t} & \leq 4
\end{align*}
Now we check some values:
\begin{align*}
\left(\sfrac{4}{3}\right)^{1} \approx 1.333 & < 4 \\
\left(\sfrac{4}{3}\right)^{2} \approx 1.778 & < 4 \\
\left(\sfrac{4}{3}\right)^{3} \approx 2.370 & < 4 \\ 
\left(\sfrac{4}{3}\right)^{4} \approx 3.160 & < 4 \\
\left(\sfrac{4}{3}\right)^{5} \approx 4.214 & > 4 \quad \checkmark
\end{align*}
Thus, $t=5$, which corresponds to Friday.

In the five-sided star shown, the letters $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and $E$ are replaced by the numbers $3$, $5$, $6$, $7$, and $9$, although not necessarily in this order. The sums of the numbers at the ends of the line segments $\overline{AB}$, $\overline{BC}$, $\overline{CD}$, $\overline{DE}$, and $\overline{EA}$ form an arithmetic sequence, although not necessarily in this order. What is the middle term of the arithmetic sequence?

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[height=3cm,page=1]{2021-06-25-figure-03}
\end{center}

\fbox{(A) $9$ \quad (B) $10$ \quad (C) $11$ \quad (D) $12$ \quad (E) $13$}

\begin{answer}
The sums of the numbers at the ends of the line segments are:
\begin{align*}
(A + B) + (B + C) + (C + D) + (D + E) + (E + A) = 2 (A + B + C + D + E)
\end{align*}
Letters $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, $E$ are replaced by $3$, $5$, $6$, $7$, and $9$, so the sum is:
\begin{align*}
A + B + C + D + E = 3 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 9 = 30
\end{align*}
Thus, the arithmetic sequence sums to $2 \times 30 = 60$. It is a property of an arithmetic sequence that the middle term must be the average, $60/5=12$.

In the eight-term sequence $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, $E$, $F$, $G$, $H$, the value of $C$ is 5 and the sum of any three consecutive terms is 30. What is $A + H$?

\fbox{(A) $17$ \quad (B) $18$ \quad (C) $25$ \quad (D) $26$ \quad (E) $43$}

\begin{answer}
We have the following implications:
\begin{align*}
& A + B + C = 30, 
& & C = 5
& & \quad\Rightarrow\quad 
B = 25 - A \\
& B + C + D = 30, 
& & B + C = 30 - A
& & \quad\Rightarrow\quad 
D = A \\
& C + D + E = 30, 
& & C + D = 5 + A
& & \quad\Rightarrow\quad 
E = 25 - A \\
& D + E + F = 30, 
& & D + E = 25
& & \quad\Rightarrow\quad 
F = 5 \\
& E + F + G = 30, 
& & E + F = 30 - A
& & \quad\Rightarrow\quad 
G = A \\
& F + G + H = 30, 
& & F + G = 5 + A
& & \quad\Rightarrow\quad 
H = 25 - A
\end{align*}
The last line implies
\begin{align*}
A + H = 25
\end{align*}
\begin{empheq}[box={\mathbox[colback=white]}]{equation*}

Let $a_1$, $a_2$, $\dots$ be a sequence for which $a_1 = 2$, $a_2 = 3$, and $a_n = a_{n - 1}/a_{n - 2}$ for each positive integer $n \ge 3$. What is $a_{2006}$?

\fbox{(A) $\frac{1}{2}$ \quad (B) $\frac{2}{3}$ \quad (C) $\frac{3}{2}$ \quad (D) $2$ \quad (E) $3$}

\begin{answer}
Calculating the first few terms  of the sequence:
\begin{align*}
a_{1} & = 2 \\
a_{2} & = 3 \\
a_{3} & = 3/2 \\ 
a_{4} & = 1/2 \\
a_{5} & = 1/3 \\
a_{6} & = 2/3 \\
a_{7} & = 2 \\
a_{8} & = 3
\end{align*}
The sequence repeats every $6$ terms: $a_{7}=a_{1}$, $a_{8}=a_{2}$, \ldots. Since $2004=6\times334$, it follows that $2006$ leaves a remainder of $2$ when divided by $6$. That is $2006 \equiv 2 \bmod{6}$. And thus,
\begin{align*}
 a_{2006} = a_{2}
\end{align*}
\begin{empheq}[box={\mathbox[colback=white]}]{equation*}
    a_{2006} = 3

Suppose that $\{a_n\}$ is an arithmetic sequence with $a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_{100} = 100$ and $a_{101} + a_{102} + \dots + a_{200} = 200$. What is the value of $a_2 - a_1$?

\fbox{(A) $0.0001$ \quad (B) $0.001$ \quad (C) $0.01$ \quad (D) $0.1$ \quad (E) $1$}

\begin{answer}
Subtract the two equations:
\begin{align*}
(a_{101} - a_1) + (a_{102} - a_2) + \ldots + (a_{200} - a_{100}) 
= 200 - 100 = 100
\end{align*}
This gives the common difference of every hundred terms repeated one hundred times. Thus the common difference between two terms in the sequence separated by $100$ positions is $1$. The common difference of two sequential terms is one-hundredth of that:
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{100} = 1

Let $\{a_k\}$ be a sequence of integers such that $a_1 = 1$ and $a_{m + n} = a_m + a_n + mn$, for all positive integers $m$ and $n$. Then $a_{12}$ is

\fbox{(A) $45$ \quad (B) $56$ \quad (C) $67$ \quad (D) $78$ \quad (E) $89$}

\begin{answer}
Let $m=1$. We have $a_{n+1}=1+a_n+n$. The first few terms in the sequence are:
\begin{align*}
  a_{1} & = 1 \\
  a_{2} & = 1 + a_{1} + 1\\
  a_{3} & = 1 + a_{2} + 2\\
 \ldots & \qquad \ldots \\
 a_{12} & = 1 + a_{11} + 11
\end{align*}
Adding up the left- and right-hand sides, all the $a_{n}$ terms cancel out except $a_{12}$:
\begin{align*}
a_{12} & = 12 + (1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + 11) \\
       & = 12 + \frac{11 \cdot 12}{2} \\
       & = 12 + 66 \\
       & = 78

The first four terms in an arithmetic sequence are $x + y$, $x - y$, $xy$, and $x/y$, in that order. What is the fifth term?

\fbox{(A) $-\frac{15}{8}$ \quad (B) $-\frac{6}{5}$ \quad (C) $0$ \quad (D) $\frac{27}{20}$ \quad (E)  $\frac{123}{40}$}

\begin{answer}
The difference between consecutive terms, obtained from the first two terms, is $(x-y)-(x+y)=-2y.$ We can also express the third and fourth terms by adding the common difference, which gives the equivalent sequence:
\begin{align*}
& x+y, && x-y, && xy, && x/y \\
& x+y, && x-y, && x-3y, && x-5y
\end{align*}
Equating the third terms gives:
\begin{align*}
     xy & =x-3y \\ 
 x(y-1) & =-3y \\ 
      x & = \frac{-3y}{y-1} 
\end{align*}
Equating the fourth terms and substituting the expression above to eliminate $x$:
\begin{align*}
   \frac{x}{y} & = x-5y \\[1ex]
\frac{-3}{y-1} & = \frac{-3y}{y-1}-5y \\[1ex]
            -3 & = -3y-5y(y-1) \\[1ex]
     5y^2-2y-3 & = 0
\end{align*}
We have a quadratic in $y$, which may be factored as
\begin{align*}
   (5y+3)(y-1) & = 0
\end{align*}

If $y=1$, the sequence would be:
\begin{align*}
x+1, \quad x-1, \quad x, \quad x
\end{align*}
which is not arithmetic. So we reject $y=1$.

The correct solution is the pair:
\begin{align*}
x = -\frac{9}{8}, \quad y = -\frac{3}{5}
\end{align*}

The fifth term in the sequence is therefore
\begin{align*}
\frac{x}{y} - 2y 
  = \frac{-9/8}{-3/5} -2\left(\frac{-3}{5}\right)
  = \frac{45}{24} + \frac{6}{5} 
  = \frac{123}{40}
\end{align*}

    \frac{123}{40}

Let $a_1$, $a_2$, $\dots$ be a sequence with the following properties.

(i)  \quad $a_1 = 1$, and

(ii) \quad $a_{2n} = n \cdot a_n$ for any positive integer $n$.

What is the value of $a_{2^{100}}$? (The subscript is $2^{100}$.)

\fbox{(A) 1 \quad (B) $2^{99}$ \quad (C) $2^{100}$ \quad (D) $2^{4950}$ \quad (E) $2^{9999}$}

\begin{answer}
Let $n=2^{99}$ and use $a_{2n}=na_{n}$,
\begin{align*}
2^{100} = 2 \times 2^{99} 
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
a_{2^{100}} 
  = a_{2 \cdot 2^{99}}
  = 2^{99} a_{2^{99}}
\end{align*}
Applying the same rule repeatedly gives:
\begin{align*}
a_{2^{100}} 
  = 2^{99} 2^{98} a_{2^{98}} 
  = 2^{99} 2^{98} 2^{97} a_{2^{97}} 
  = 2^{99} 2^{98} 2^{97} \ldots 2 a_{2}
\end{align*}
where $a_{2}=a_{1}=1$. So we have
\begin{align*}
a_{2^{100}} 
 & = 2^{99 + 98 + \ldots + 2 + 1} \\
 & = 2^{\frac{99(100)}{2}} \\
