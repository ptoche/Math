## Overview

Notes taken while watching Professor Po-Shen Loh's "Ask Math Anything" videos on his YouTube channel.

I try to write most of the notes during the streaming. But I typically spend an hour polishing it up and if there are graphics to draw, up to three hours! I do this for my own entertainment, but I'm happy to make the notes available. Unfortunately I am not able to watch every video.

Please report any typos/errors.
