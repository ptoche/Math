Answer: PV= $86,998,184.72 Step-by-step explanation: Giving the following information: Annual payments= $17,285,714.29 Number of years= 7 Interest rate= 9% First, we need to determine the future value incorporating the interest rate. FV= {A*[(1+i)^n-1]}/i A= annual payment FV= {17,285,714.29* [(1.09^7) - 1]} / 0.09 FV= $159,036,085.1 Now, we can calculate the present value: PV= FV/(1+i)^n PV= 159,036,085.1/1.09^7 PV= $86,998,184.72
