Dear Mrs Messler,

Thank you so much for your kind words. James was pleased with his performance. I attended the virtual "correction" of the Chapter Invitational and am putting together some notes so James can build up from there. There were several questions that James couldn't do at the time which now seem within his reach, so we very much hope that he will be able to improve next year, with his target to go on to the State level. He ranked 20th at the Invitational and would have to make up 15 places to be in the top 5, so it won't be easy!

I have written a short text intended for the Clairbourn eCourier. We would love if you would elaborate about your coaching in a few sentences to be incorporated in the text. Families read the eCourier with great interest and it would surely motivate the team for next year! 


Write-up for the Clairbourn eCourier:
MATHCOUNTS is a nationwide middle school mathematics competition that covers problems in geometry, counting, probability, number theory, and algebra. Contestants solve 30 short problems in 40 minutes, followed by 8 longer problems in 24 minutes. The competition is divided into several rounds and eventually the top competitors go on to represent their state at the national level. In February Clairbourn's Mathcounts team competed with other schools in the Valley representing a strong field of 142 middle schoolers. Seventh grader James Toche proudly competed for Clairbourn at the competition's second round (the Chapter Invitational), where he eventually ranked 20th. "There were some hard questions and so little time. It was quite a thrill. Mrs Messler's coaching helped so much, and it was fun, we will come stronger next year. Go Cougar!"


James's dad, Patrick Toche.


James placed 20/128 at the Mathcounts Chapter Invitational competition.

I looked through the test and your answers, and you did an awesome job, even though you didn't make it to the next round. Those are very advanced problems that you are able to do! I can't wait for next year's competition!
