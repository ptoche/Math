\subsection*{1.}
What is the arithmetic mean of the terms in the arithmetic sequence $12$, $18$, $24$, $30$, $36$?

\nopagebreak

\fbox{\phantom{ANSWER}}

\begin{answer}
You could calculate it ($(12+18+24+30+36)/5=24$), but you can get the result without calculations by noting that the mean of an arithmetic sequence is its median, that is if $a$ denotes the increment, we have:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{Q{2cm}Q{2cm}Q{2cm}Q{2cm}Q{2cm}}
   12, &   18, & 24, & 30,   & 36 \\
24-2a, & 24-a, & 24, & 24+a, & 24+2a
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
When you calculate the sum, the $-2a$ term is canceled by $+2a$ and $-a$ is canceled by $+a$, leaving $(5 \times 24)/5=24$.

Let $a\&b=ab+b+a-1$. If $a\&7=70$, what is $a\&3$?

\nopagebreak

\fbox{\phantom{ANSWER}}~

\begin{answer}
A simple matter of substituting $7$ for $b$:
\begin{align*}
a\&7 = 70 
\quad\Rightarrow\quad 
7a + 7 + a - 1 = 70 
\quad\Rightarrow\quad 
a = \frac{70-6}{8} = 8
\end{align*}
and then substituting both $8$ for $a$ and $3$ for $b$:
\begin{align*}
a\&3 = 8\&3 = 8 \times 3 + 3 + 8 - 1 = 34

  We are looking for the ``smallest'' pair of integers $(u,v)$ such that:
  \begin{align*}
  7\,\text{hours} + (11u)\,\text{minutes} = 7\,\text{hours} + (5 + 15v)\,\text{minutes}
  \end{align*}
  or equivalently:
  \begin{align*}
  11u = 5(1 + 3v)
  \end{align*}
  It follows that $u$ must be a multiple of $5$, while $1+3v$ must be a multiple of $11$. Since we are looking for ``small'' values of $u$ and $v$, we can start guessing with $u=5,10,15$, etc.. 
  \begin{align*}
  u & = 5 \quad \frac{11 \times 5}{5} = 11 = 1 + 3v  \Rightarrow v = \frac{10}{3} \quad \notin\mathbb{N} \quad\text{\faTimes} \\
  u & = 10 \quad \frac{11 \times 5}{10} = 22 = 1 + 3v \Rightarrow v = \frac{21}{3} = 7 \quad \in\mathbb{N} \quad\text{\faCheck}
  \end{align*}
  Our second attempt yields a solution: $u=10$, $v=7$,
  implying that Kody wakes up at $7\,\text{hours}$ and $110\,\text{minutes}$ or, equivalently $8\,\text{hours}$ and $50\,\text{minutes}$.

\subsection*{18.}
The largest rectangular region shown is partitioned into three rectangular regions labeled $A$, $B$, and $C$. The lengths, in inches, of rectangles $A$, $B$, and $C$ are $n+3$, $n+5$ and $n-2$, respectively, and all three rectangles have width $n$. If the area of rectangle $B$ is $84$in$^2$, what is the perimeter of the largest rectangle shown?

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=5cm]{sprint-18-figure}
\end{center}

\nopagebreak

\fbox{\phantom{ANSWER}}~inches

\begin{answer}
The area of rectangle $B$ is $n(n+5)$, which yields a quadratic equation in $n$:
\begin{align*}
   n^2 + 5n = 84
\end{align*}
Completing the square:
\begin{align*}
   n^2 + 5n & = 84 \\
   \left(n + \frac{5}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{5}{2}\right)^2 & = 84 \\
   \left(n + \frac{5}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{25+4 \times 84}{2^2}\right) & = 0 \\
   \left(n + \frac{5}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{19}{2}\right)^2 & = 0 
\end{align*}
where the last step follows from $25+4\times84=25+336=361=19^2$.
To complete the square, recall that $a^2-b^2=(a-b)(a+b)$. Thus,
\begin{align*}
   \left(n+\frac{5}{2}-\frac{19}{2}\right)  \left(n+\frac{5}{2}+\frac{19}{2}\right) & = 0 \\
   (n-7)(n+12) & = 0 
\end{align*}
(This solution could have been guessed if we had had good reasons to believe that the solutions were integers)
Since $n$ must be positive, $n=7$. 
The perimeter of the largest rectangle is 
\begin{align*}
2 \times [n + (n+3) + (n+5) + (n-2)] 
  = 2 (4n+6) 
  = 2 (28+6)
  = 68

What is the length of the longest diagonal of the rectangular prism shown, which has length $9$\,cm, width $8$\,cm and height $12$\,cm?

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=6cm,page=1]{sprint-19-figure}
\end{center}

\nopagebreak

\fbox{\phantom{ANSWER}}~cm

\begin{answer}
The longest diagonal along the surface of the prism is clearly \begin{align*}
\sqrt{9^2+12^2} = \sqrt{81+144} = \sqrt{225} = 15
\end{align*}
But it is readily apparent that the ``inner'' diagonal --- the red line in the figure below --- is longer. The length of the red, dotted diagonal is:
\begin{align*}
\sqrt{9^2+8^2} = \sqrt{81+64} = \sqrt{145} ~~(\approx 12)
\end{align*}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=6cm,page=2]{sprint-19-figure}
\end{center}
Putting it together yields:
\begin{align*}
\sqrt{145+144} = \sqrt{289} = 17
\end{align*}
Quick calculation: If the width/length/height of a rectangular prism are $x$, $y$, $z$, the longest diagonal has length $\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}$.

\nopagebreak

\fbox{\phantom{ANSWER}}$\sqrt{\fbox{\phantom{ANSWER}}}$

\begin{answer}
We start by drawing the basic figure:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=8cm,page=1]{sprint-21-figure}
\end{center}
We add the projection of $A$ onto segment $BC$ and label the unknown lengths $x$ and $y$. 
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=8cm,page=2]{sprint-21-figure}
\end{center}
Applying the Pythagoras theorem to triangles $APC$ and $APB$ yields a system of two equations in two unknowns:
\begin{align*}
x^2 + y^2 & = 11^2 \\
x^2 + (15-y)^2 & = 16^2
\end{align*}
While the system appears to be non-linear, it may be simplified. Develop the square in the second equation:
\begin{align*}
x^2 + 15^2 - 30 y + y^2 = 16^2
\end{align*}
Substitute the first equation into the above and rearrange:
\begin{align*}
30 y & = 11^2 - 16^2 + 15^2\\
y & = \frac{90}{30} = 3
\end{align*}
With $y$ we can now find $x$:
\begin{align*}
x^2 & = 11^2 - 3^2 = 112 \\
  x & = \sqrt{112} = 4 \sqrt{7}
\end{align*}

\fbox{\phantom{ANSWER}}~boxes

\begin{answer}
Starting with the maximal feasible number of the larger boxes --- $5$ items per box --- and going down from there, we get close but not quite there:

If we remove one $25$-box and complement with several $10$-box, we now get to $815$ marbles:
\begin{align*}
5 \times 100 \quad+\quad 5 \times 50 \quad+\quad 1 \times 25 \quad+\quad 4 \times 10 \quad=\quad 815

\end{center}
Consider the right triangle connecting the centers of one small circle, of the medium (shaded) circle and of the large circle. Let $r$ denote the (unknown) radius of the medium circle. The hypotenuse of the triangle has length $1+r$, the sum of the radius of the medium circle, $r$, and of the radius of the small circle, $1$. The shorter (vertical) leg of the triangle has length equal to the difference between the radius of the large circle and the radius of the medium circle, $5-r$. The longer (horizontal) leg of the triangle has length equal to the difference between the radius of the large circle and one of the small circles, or $5-1=4$. The radius $r$ can be found by applying the Pythagoras theorem:
\begin{align*}
4^2 + (5-r)^2 & = (r + 1)^2 \\
16 + 25 - 10r + r^2 & = r^2 + 2r + 1 
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
r = \frac{40}{12} = \frac{10}{3}
\end{align*}

\subsection*{26.}
The greatest of three nonnegative integers is one more than twice the sum of the other two integers. The arithmetic mean of the three integers, rounded to the nearest integer, happens to equal the median of the set. What is the product of the three integers?

\nopagebreak

\fbox{\phantom{ANSWER}}

\begin{answer}
Let $a \leq b \leq c$. We have (we guess strict inequalities because of the reference to ``rounding'', but rounding is consistent with one binding inequality):
\begin{align*}
& c \,=\, 1 + 2 (a + b) \\
& b - 1 \quad<\quad \frac{a + b + c}{3} \quad<\quad b + 1
\end{align*}
Eliminating $(a+b)=(c-1)/2$ by substitution yields: 
\begin{alignat*}{4}
b - 1 
    \quad & <
    \quad & 
        \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{c-1}{2} + c\right) 
    \quad & < 
    \quad & \quad 
        b + 1 \\
\frac{6(b-1)+1}{3}
    \quad & <
    \quad & 
        c \quad\quad\;
    \quad & <
    \quad & \quad 
        \frac{6(b+1)+1}{3} \\
2b-1-\frac{2}{3}
    \quad & <
    \quad & 
        c \quad\quad\;
    \quad & <
    \quad & \quad 
        2b+2+\frac{1}{3}
\end{alignat*}
Since $2b-1$ and $2b+2$ are integers, we can simplify the inequality as:
\begin{align*}
2b-1 \quad\leq\quad c \quad\leq\quad 2b+2
\end{align*}
This inequality implies that $c$ could be equal to $2b-1$, $2b$, $2b+1$, or $2b+2$. But from $c=1+2(a+b)$, we can narrow down the guess to either $c=2b+1$ or $c=2b+2$. The first case implies $a=0$, which is not ruled out by the condition that the integers be ``nonnegative''. However we clearly must have $b>0$. The simplest guess is then $a=0$ and $b=1$, which yields $c=3$ and the inequality becomes $2 \leq 3 \leq  4$, which holds. This guess satisfies the conditions of the problem and the product of the integers is therefore
\begin{align*}
abc = 0 \times 1 \times 3 = 0
\end{align*}

Suppose $p(x)$ is a polynomial such that $p(x) = p(1) + p(2) \cdot x + x^2$ for all numbers $x$. What is the value of $p(5)$?

\nopagebreak

\fbox{\phantom{ANSWER}}

\begin{answer}
Setting $x=1$ yields:
\begin{align*}
p(1) = p(1) + p(2) \cdot 1 + 1^2
  \quad\Rightarrow\quad
p(2) = -1
\end{align*}
Setting $x=2$ yields:
\begin{align*}
p(2) = p(1) + p(2) \cdot 2 + 2^2
  \quad\Rightarrow\quad
-1 = p(1) - 2 + 4
  \quad\Rightarrow\quad
p(1) = -3
\end{align*}
The polynomial is therefore:
\begin{align*}
p(x) = -3 - x + x^2
\end{align*}
Setting $x=5$ yields:
\begin{align*}
p(5) = -3 - 5 + 5^2 = 17

Let $\floor*{n}$ be defined as the greatest integer less than or equal to $n$. What is the value of $n$ if $\floor*{n} \times n = 3$? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth. 

\nopagebreak

\fbox{\phantom{ANSWER}}

\begin{answer}
If $n$ were an integer, the condition would reduce to $\floor*{n} \times n = n^2$ and
\begin{align*}
 n^2 = 3 \quad\Rightarrow\quad n \approx \pm 1.7
\end{align*}
The contradiction confirms that $n$ cannot be an integer. Furthermore it is clear that 
\begin{align*}
 1.0 < |n| < 1.7
\end{align*}
Since $\floor*{+1.x}=1$ for all digits $x$, it follows that $n$ must be negative. Since $\floor*{-1.x}=-2$, we have 
\begin{align*}
 \floor*{n} \times n = -2n = 3 \quad\Rightarrow\quad n = -1.5
\end{align*}

Square ABCD, shown here, has side length $6$ units. Points P and Q are located on sides AD and BC, respectively, with $\text{AP}=\text{BQ}=1$ unit. Triangles ACP and BDQ overlap in the square to form the shaded quadrilateral. What is the area of the shaded quadrilateral? Express your answer as a common fraction.

\begin{answer}
For clarity, add labels to the shaded quadrilateral: 
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=5cm,page=2]{sprint-29-figure}
\end{center}

In general, the area of a quadrilateral is equal to half the product of its diagonals. If we denote by $h$ the vertical diagonal, or `height', and by $w$ the horizontal diagonal, or `width', the area is equal to:
\begin{align*}
\frac{wh}{2}
\end{align*}
as can be seen from the figure (the area is half of the area of the four rectangles marked by dashed lines):
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=8cm,page=4]{sprint-29-figure}
\end{center}
Here the height is the distance OT, where O (`Origin') is the center of the square, and T is the intersection of CP and DQ. 

The height of the quadrilateral follows immediately from the ``Intercept theorem'' (known in France as Thales's theorem, but distinct from another theorem attributed to Thales that states that the triangle formed by the diameter of a circle and any other point on the circle has a right angle!). The Intercept theorem states that Given two parallel lines BD and CE and two non-parallel lines AC and AE, the following ratios hold:
\begin{align*}
\frac{\text{AC}}{\text{AB}} 
  = \frac{\text{AE}}{\text{AD}} 
  = \frac{\text{CE}}{\text{BD}} 
\end{align*} 
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=8cm,page=5]{sprint-29-figure}
\end{center}

Applying the Intercept Theorem to lines DB and DQ gives the height of the quadrilateral:
\begin{align*}
\frac{\text{DQ}}{\text{DT}} 
  = \frac{\text{DB}}{\text{DO}} 
  = \frac{\text{BQ}}{\text{OT}} 
\end{align*}
From $\text{DB}=2\text{DO}$ (the center of the square O cuts the diagonal DB in half) and $\text{BQ}=1$ (as stated in the question), it follows that the height of the quadrilateral is $\text{OT}=1/2$, or
\begin{align*}
h = \frac{1}{2}
\end{align*}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=8cm,page=3]{sprint-29-figure}
\end{center}
Next, we calculate the width of the quadrilateral $w$. A simple method shown by Prof. Po Shen Loh is to consider the coordinate system centered at A and formed by an $x$-axis along AB and a $y$-axis along AD. In this system, the $x$-coordinate of the intersection of AC with DQ (point S) can be used to calculate distance RS (i.e. the width $w$). Namely, subtract the $x$-coordinate of O from the $x$-coordinate of S to get half the distance RS (i.e. $w/2$). 

In the coordinate system (AB, AD), the equations of AC and DQ are:
\begin{align*}
  \begin{cases}
  y = x \\
  y = 6 - \dfrac{5}{6}x
  \end{cases}
\end{align*}
The first equation is obvious, since AC is the diagonal of the square. The second equation holds because the $y$-intercept (distance AD) is $6$ and line DQ falls by $5$ units for every rightward displacement of $6$ units: equivalently, point Q is at coordinate $(6,1/6)$. 
Solving for the $x$-coordinate at the intersection of these two equations yields:
\begin{align*}
x = 6 - \frac{5}{6}x 
\quad\Rightarrow\quad 
x = \frac{36}{11}
\end{align*}
Since the $x$-coordinate of O is $3$, we get
\begin{align*}
\frac{w}{2} = \frac{36}{11} - 3 = \frac{3}{11}
\end{align*}
and the area is therefore 
\begin{align*}
h \times \frac{w}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{3}{11} = \frac{3}{22}
\end{align*}
\begin{empheq}[box={\mathbox[colback=white]}]{equation*}
    \frac{3}{22}~\text{units}^2

\subsection*{30.}
How many ordered triples of positive integers $(a,b,c)$ have $GCF(a,b,c)=2020$ and $LCM(a,b,c)=2020^2$?

\nopagebreak

\fbox{\phantom{ANSWER}}~ordered triples

\begin{answer}
As this is the last question of the Sprint round, we expect it to be quite difficult. Typical of competitions held in 2020-2021, the number $2020$ shows up. Its factors are easy to find if you know that $101$ is a prime number. But be prepared for $2021 = 43 \times 47$, which is not so obvious.
\begin{align*}
2020 = 2^2 \times 5 \times 101
\end{align*}
The problem's conditions may be written: 
\begin{align*}
GCF(a,b,c) & = 2^2 \cdot 5 \cdot 101 \\
LCM(a,b,c) & = 2^4 \cdot 5^2 \cdot 101^2
\end{align*}
The $GCF$ implies that $a$, $b$, $c$ are all divisible by $2$, $5$, $101$. The $LCM$ implies that they do not have any other prime factor. Thus, we have
\begin{align*}
a = 2^{\square} \times 5^{\square} \times 101^{\square} \\
b = 2^{\square} \times 5^{\square} \times 101^{\square} \\
c = 2^{\square} \times 5^{\square} \times 101^{\square} 
\end{align*}
for some integer powers to be determined. How many possibilities are there for these exponents? 

First consider the powers of $2$. 
Since $GCF\propto2^2$, the smallest power is $2^2$. 
Since $LCM\propto2^4$, the largest power is $2^4$. 
This gives three choices for assigning powers of $2$ to $(a,b,c)$:
\begin{align*}
(2^2, 2^2, 2^4) \quad\text{or}\quad 
(2^2, 2^4, 2^4) \quad\text{or}\quad 
(2^2, 2^3, 2^4)
\end{align*}
How many ways are there to assign the powers of $2$ to $(a,b,c)$?
There are $3$ ways to assign $(2^2,2^2,2^4)$. Likewise, there are $3$ ways to assign $(2^2,2^4,2^4)$. However, there are $6$ ways to assign $(2^2,2^3,2^4)$. Thus, there are $3+3+6=12$ ways to assign the powers of $2$. 

Now turn to the powers of $5$. 
How many ways are there to assign the powers of $5$ to $(a,b,c)$? 
They each have to be $5^1$ or $5^2$, so the powers of $5$ can be $(5^1,5^1,5^2)$ or $(5^1,5^2,5^2)$. There are $3$ ways to assign $(5^1,5^1,5^2)$ (to see this, choose whichever of the exponents is different from the other two). Thus, there are $3+3=6$ ways to assign $(5^1,5^1,5^2)$. 
Now turn to the powers of $101$. Just as for the powers of $5$, there are $6$ ways to assign the powers of $101$. 

Now consider all possible combinations. The total number of ways is obtained by multiplying the three cases, since the choice of the exponents for each prime are independent of each other:  
\begin{align*}
12 \times 6 \times 6 = 432
\end{align*}
ordered triples $(a,b,c)$.
