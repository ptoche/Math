\subsection*{1.}
What is the arithmetic mean of the terms in the arithmetic sequence $12$, $18$, $24$, $30$, $36$?

\nopagebreak

\fbox{\phantom{ANSWER}}

\begin{answer}
\begin{tikzpicture}\node[textbox]{%
    \begin{minipagex}{\dimexpr\textwidth-20pt}
        You could calculate it ($(12+18+24+30+36)/5=24$), but you can get the result without calculations by noting that the mean of an arithmetic sequence is its median, that is if $a$ denotes the increment, we have:
        \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{Q{2cm}Q{2cm}Q{2cm}Q{2cm}Q{2cm}}
           12, &   18, & 24, & 30,   & 36 \\
        24-2a, & 24-a, & 24, & 24+a, & 24+2a
        \end{tabular}
        \end{center}
        When you calculate the sum, the $-2a$ term is canceled by $+2a$ and $-a$ is canceled by $+a$, leaving $(5 \times 24)/5=24$.

        The area of rectangle $B$ is $n(n+5)$, which yields a quadratic equation in $n$:
        \begin{align*}
           n^2 + 5n = 84

        Completing the square:

           \left(n + \frac{5}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{5}{2}\right)^2 & = 84 \\

           \left(n + \frac{5}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{19}{2}\right)^2 & = 0 
        \end{align*}
        where the last step follows from $25+4\times84=25+336=361=19^2$.
        To complete the square, recall that $a^2-b^2=(a-b)(a+b)$. Thus,
        \begin{align*}

        We start by drawing the basic figure:
        \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[height=6cm]{sprint-21-figure-1}

        We add the projection of $A$ onto segment $BC$ and label the unknown lengths $x$ and $y$.

        Applying the Pythagoras theorem to triangles $APC$ and $APB$ yields a system of two equations in two unknowns:
        \begin{align*}
        x^2 + y^2 & = 16^2 \\
        x^2 + (15-y)^2 & = 11^2
        \end{align*}
        While the system appears to be non-linear, it may be simplified. Developing the square:
        \begin{align*}
        x^2 + y^2 & = 16^2 \\
        x^2 + y^2 & = 11^2 - (15^2 - 2 \times 15 y)
        \end{align*}
        Substitute the first equation into the second one:
        \begin{align*}
        30 y & = 16^2 - 11^2 + 15^2\\
        y & = 12
        \end{align*}
        With $y$ we can now find $x$:
        \begin{align*}
        x^2 & = 16^2 - y^2 = 16^2 - 12^2 = 112 \\
          x & = \sqrt{112} = 4 \sqrt{7}

\nopagebreak

\fbox{\phantom{ANSWER}}

\begin{answer}
\begin{tikzpicture}\node[textbox]{%
    \begin{minipagex}{\dimexpr\textwidth-20pt}
        Let $a \leq b \leq c$. We have (we guess strict inequalities because of the reference to ``rounding'', but rounding is consistent with one binding inequality):
        \begin{align*}
        & c \,=\, 1 + 2 (a + b) \\
        & b - 1 \quad<\quad \frac{a + b + c}{3} \quad<\quad b + 1
        \end{align*}
        Eliminating $(a+b)=(c-1)/2$ by substitution yields: 
        \begin{alignat*}{4}
        b - 1 
            \quad & <
            \quad & 
                \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{c-1}{2} + c\right) 
            \quad & < 
            \quad & \quad 
                b + 1 \\
        \frac{6(b-1)+1}{3}
            \quad & <
            \quad & 
                c \quad\quad\;
            \quad & <
            \quad & \quad 
                \frac{6(b+1)+1}{3} \\
        2b-1-\frac{2}{3}
            \quad & <
            \quad & 
                c \quad\quad\;
            \quad & <
            \quad & \quad 
                2b+2+\frac{1}{3}
        \end{alignat*}
        Since $2b-1$ and $2b+2$ are integers, we can simplify the inequality as:
        \begin{align*}
        2b-1 \quad\leq\quad c \quad\leq\quad 2b+2
        \end{align*}
        This inequality implies that $c$ could be equal to $2b-1$, $2b$, $2b+1$, or $2b+2$. But from $c=1+2(a+b)$, we can narrow down the guess to either $c=2b+1$ or $c=2b+2$. The first case implies $a=0$, which is not ruled out by the condition that the integers be ``nonnegative''. However we clearly must have $b>0$. The simplest guess is then $a=0$ and $b=1$, which yields $c=3$ and the inequality becomes $2 \leq 3 \leq  4$, which holds. This guess satisfies the conditions of the problem and the product of the integers is therefore
        \begin{align*}
        abc = 0 \times 1 \times 3 = 0
        \end{align*}
        \begin{empheq}[box={\mathbox[colback=white]}]{equation*}

    \begin{minipagex}{\dimexpr\textwidth-20pt}
        TODO WRITEUP UNFINISHED
        
        The $GCF$ implies that the smallest one must be $2$. The $LCM$ implies that the largest one must be $4$. While the third one could be any of $2$, $3$, or $4$. This gives three choices for the powers of $2$, namely
        \begin{align*}
        2^2, 2^2, 2^4 \quad\text{or}\quad 
        2^2, 2^3, 2^4 \quad\text{or}\quad 
        2^2, 2^4, 2^4
        \end{align*}
        How many ways are there to assign the powers of $2$ to $a$, $b$, $c$?
        There are $3$ ways to assign $2^2$, $2^2$, $2^4$. Likewise, there are $3$ ways to assign $2^2$, $2^4$, $2^4$. However, there are $6$ ways to assign $2^2$, $2^3$, $2^4$. Thus, there are $6+3+3=12$ ways to assign the powers of $2$. 
        
        Now turn to the exponents of $5$. We have
        \begin{align*}
        GCF(a,b,c) & = 2^2 \cdot 5 \cdot 101 \\
        LCM(a,b,c) & = 2^4 \cdot 5^2 \cdot 101^2
        \end{align*}
        
        The $GCF$ implies that $a$, $b$, $c$ are all divisible by $2$, $5$, $101$. The $LCM$ implies that they do not have any other prime factor --- the prime factors can only include $2$, $5$, and $101$. Thus, we have
        \begin{align*}
        a = 2^x_a 5^y_a 101^z_a \\
        b = 2^x_b 5^y_b 101^z_b \\
        c = 2^x_c 5^y_c 101^z_c
        \end{align*}
        for some integer powers to be determined. How many possibilities are there for the exponents? 
        
        They each have to be $5^1$ or $5^2$.
        So the powers of $5$ can be $5^1$, $5^1$, $5^2$ or $5^1$, $5^2$, $5^2$. In how many ways can we assign each of those to $a$, $b$, and $c$? We can assign each pattern to $a$, $b$, $c$ in $3$ different ways, that is: choose whichever of the exponents is different from the other two. This gives $6$ ways to assign the powers of $5$. How about the powers of $101$? Likewise, there are $6$ ways to assign the powers of $101$. The total number of ways is obtained by multiplying the three cases, since the choice of the exponents for each prime are independent of each other:  
        \begin{align*}
        12 \times 6 \times 6 = 432
