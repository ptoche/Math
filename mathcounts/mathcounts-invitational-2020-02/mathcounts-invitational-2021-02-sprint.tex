\subsection*{1.}
What is the arithmetic mean of the terms in the arithmetic sequence $12$, $18$, $24$, $30$, $36$?

\nopagebreak

\fbox{\phantom{ANSWER}}

\begin{answer}
\begin{tikzpicture}\node[textbox]{%
    \begin{minipagex}{\dimexpr\textwidth-20pt}
        You could calculate it ($(12+18+24+30+36)/5=24$), but you can get the result without calculations by noting that the mean of an arithmetic sequence is its median, that is if $a$ denotes the increment, we have:
        \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{Q{2cm}Q{2cm}Q{2cm}Q{2cm}Q{2cm}}
           12, &   18, & 24, & 30,   & 36 \\
        24-2a, & 24-a, & 24, & 24+a, & 24+2a
        \end{tabular}
        \end{center}
        When you calculate the sum, the $-2a$ term is canceled by $+2a$ and $-a$ is canceled by $+a$, leaving $(5 \times 24)/5=24$.

        The distance between $A$ and $B$ is the hypotenuse of the triangle with side lengths $3$ and $4$. Therefore

\begin{answer}
\begin{tikzpicture}\node[textbox]{%
    \begin{minipagex}{\dimexpr\textwidth-20pt}
        The area of rectangle $B$ is $n(n+5)$, which yields a quadratic equation in $n$:
        \begin{align*}
           n^2 + 5n = 84
        \end{align*}
        Completing the square:
        \begin{align*}
           n^2 + 5n & = 84 \\
           \left(n + \frac{5}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{5}{2}\right)^2 & = 84 \\
           \left(n + \frac{5}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{25+4 \times 84}{2^2}\right) & = 0 \\
           \left(n + \frac{5}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{19}{2}\right)^2 & = 0 
        \end{align*}
        where the last step follows from $25+4\times84=25+336=361=19^2$.
        To complete the square, recall that $a^2-b^2=(a-b)(a+b)$. Thus,
        \begin{align*}
           \left(n+\frac{5}{2}\right)^2-\left(\frac{19}{2}\right)^2 & = 0 \\
           \left(n+\frac{5}{2}-\frac{19}{2}\right)  \left(n+\frac{5}{2}+\frac{19}{2}\right) & = 0 \\
\left(n+\frac{5}{2}+\frac{19}{2}\right) & = 0 
        \end{align*}
        Since $n$ must be positive, we have
        \begin{align*}
           n = -\frac{5}{2}+\frac{19}{2}
             = \frac{14}{2}

        They each have to be $5^1$ or $5^2$.
        So the powers of $5$ can be $5^1$, $5^1$, $5^2$ or $5^1$, $5^2$, $5^2$. IN how many ways can we assign each of those to $a$, $b$, and $c$? We can assign each pattern to $a$, $b$, $c$ in $3$ different ways, that is: choose whichever of the exponents is different from the other two. This gives $6$ ways to assign the powers of $5$. How about the powers of $101$? Likewise, there are $6$ ways to assign the powers of $101$. The total number of ways is obtained by multiplying the three cases, since the choice of the exponents for each prime are independent of each other:  
        \begin{align*}
        12 \times 6 \times 6 = 432
