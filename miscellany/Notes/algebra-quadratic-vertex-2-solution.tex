Rewrite the equation in the ``vertex form'':
\begin{align*}
x^2 + 2x + 3 
  & = (x + 1)^2 -1 + 3 \\
  & = (x + 1)^2 + 2 
\end{align*}
With the equation written in this way, it is obvious that $x=-1$ annuls the square term and the minimum is therefore $2$. The turning point of the graph is $(-1, 2)$. This quadratic function cannot be factored: in vertex form, it is the sum of two positive squares and therefore has no real roots (its roots are complex). Its graph lies entirely above the $x$-axis. The range of the function is $[2, \infty)$.
