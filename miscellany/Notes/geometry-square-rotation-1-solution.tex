If the larger square has side measuring $a$ units, its area is $a^2$. If the smaller square has side measuring $x$ units, its area is $x^2$. Since the side of the smaller square is the hypotenuse of the inscribed triangle, we have
\begin{align*}
x^2 = \left(\frac{a}{3}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{2a}{3}\right)^2 
    = \left(\frac{a}{3}\right)^2 (1 + 2^2) 
    = \frac{5}{9} a^2 
\end{align*}
\begin{empheq}[box={\mathbox[colback=white]}]{equation*}
    \frac{\text{outer square}}{\text{inscribed square}} = \frac{5}{9}
\end{empheq}
