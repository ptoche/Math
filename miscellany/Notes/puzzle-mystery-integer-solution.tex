Let $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$ denote the digits of the integers $abcd$, where
\begin{align*}
1 \leq a \leq 9, ~ 0 \leq b \leq 9, ~ 0 \leq c \leq 9, ~0 \leq d \leq 9
\end{align*} 
The text translates to the following set of three equations.
\begin{align*}
a + b & = c \\
b + c & = d \\
c + d & = 10a + b
\end{align*}
While these equations are linear, there are only $3$ equations for $4$ unknowns, so some clever guessing must be brought to bear on the problem. Since $a>0$ (otherwise it would not be a $4$-digit integer), the third equation implies
\begin{align*}
c + d & \geq 10
\end{align*}
In some sense, the sum $c+d$ is `large'. Meanwhile the second equation suggests that $d$ is likely to be greater than $c$ (only if $b=0$ that would not be true). So we will start to guess from $d=9$ and move down to $d=8$, $d=7$, and so on, until we hit on a solution. Thus, if $d=9$, we have:
\begin{align*}
a + b & = c \\
b + c & = 9 \\
c + 9 & = 10a + b \\
\Rightarrow a = 1, b = 4, c = 5, d = 9
\end{align*}
We hit a solution on our first attempt!
