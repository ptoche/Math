Let $a$ denote the number of adults and $c$ denote the number of children, who came to the movie between $11{:}50$a.m. and $12{:}00$p.m.
\begin{align*}
a + c & = 25 \\
\frac{a + 16}{c + 19} & = \frac{9}{11}
\end{align*}
This is a system of two equations in two unknowns, $a$ and $c$. After a simple transformation, the second equation becomes linear in $a$ and $c$.
\begin{align*}
a + c & = 25 \\
11 (a + 16) & = 9 (c + 19) \Rightarrow 11a - 9c = 9 \cdot 19 - 11 \cdot 16
\end{align*}
Since we are interested in solving for $c$, let's substitute $a$ out:
\begin{align*}
11 (25-c) - 9c & = 9 \cdot 19 - 11 \cdot 16 \\
\Rightarrow 
c & = \frac{11 \cdot 25 + 11 \cdot 16 - 9 \cdot 19}{20} 
    = \frac{11 \cdot 41 - 9 \cdot 19}{20} 
    = \frac{410 + 41 - 190 + 19}{20} \\
  & = \frac{280}{20} = 14 \\
\Rightarrow 
a & = 25 - 14 = 11
\end{align*}
