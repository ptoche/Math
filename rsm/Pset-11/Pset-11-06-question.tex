In triangle $ABC$, the medians $AD$ and $CE$ have lengths $18$ and $27$ respectively and $AB=24$. Extend $CE$ to intersect the circumcircle of $ABC$ at $F$. The area of triangle $AFB$ is $m\sqrt{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n$.
