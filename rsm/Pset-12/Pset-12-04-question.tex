Circles $\sigma_{1}$ and $\sigma_{2}$ intersect at point $X$ and $Y$. Line $l$ is tangent to $\sigma_{1}$ and $\sigma_{2}$ at $A$ and $B$ respectively, with line $AB$ closer to point $X$ than to $Y$. Circle $\sigma$ passes through $A$ and $B$ intersecting $\sigma_{1}$ again at $D \ne A$ and intersecting $\sigma_{2}$ again at $C \ne B$. The three points $C$, $Y$, $D$ are collinear, and $XC=67$, $XY=47$, and $XD=37$. Find $AB^{2}$.
