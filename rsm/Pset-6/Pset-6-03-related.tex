Find the number of ending zeros of $21!$ in base $9$. 
Count the number of times $3$ appears as a factor in $21!$
\begin{itemize}[label={}]
\item $1$ from $3$
\item $1$ from $6$
\item $2$ from $9$
\item $1$ from $12$
\item $1$ from $15$
\item $2$ from $18$
\item $1$ from $21$
\end{itemize}
There are a total of $9$ factors, so $21!$ is divisible by $3^9=3 \mult 9^4$. It is divisible by $9$ at most $4$ times, so it ends with four zeroes in base $9$.
