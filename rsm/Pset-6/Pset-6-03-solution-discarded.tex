We count the number of times $3$ appears as a factor in $2018!$.
\begin{itemize}[label={}]
\item $1$ from $3$
\item $1$ from $6$
\item $2$ from $9$
\item $1$ from $12$
\item $1$ from $15$
\item $2$ from $18$
\item $1$ from $21$
\item $\ldots$
\end{itemize}
The total count is incremented by $1$ for the number of times $3$ goes into $2018$; by $1$ for the number of times $6$ goes into $2018$, by $2$ for the number of times $9$ goes into $2018$, and the cycle repeats.
\begin{itemize}[label={}]
\item $1 \mult 224$ from $3$, $12$, $\ldots$, $2001$, $2010$.
\item $2 \mult 224$ from $6$, $18$, $\ldots$, $2004$, $2013$.
\item $1 \mult 224$ from $9$, $21$, $\ldots$, $2007$, $2016$.
\end{itemize}
There are a total of $4 \mult 224 = 896$ factors, so $218!$ is divisible by $3^{896}$. Since $896=3\mult298+2$, we have $3^{896}=3^{3\mult298+2}=9^{298}\mult3^{2}=9^{299}$. It is divisible by $9$ exactly $299$ times, so it ends in $299$ zeros in base $9$.

Solution: \fbox{$299$.}
