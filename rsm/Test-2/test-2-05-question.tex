A standard dice (a cube with $1$ to $6$ points its sides, the sum of the points on opposite sides is 7) is thrown. After the throw, we record the result, roll the cube randomly onto one of the adjacent faces, record a new result, then again randomly roll the cube onto one of the adjacent faces, and record the third result. How many different increasing sequences of points can we get?
