Let $S$ be the set of all $10$-term arithmetic progressions that include the numbers $4$ and $10$. For example, ${(-2,1,4,7,10,13,16,19,22,25)}$ and ${(10,8.5,7,5.5,4,2.5,1,-0.5,-2,-3.5)}$ are both members of $S$. Find the sum of values of $a_{10}$ for all such progressions belonging to $S$, that is find
\begin{align*}
\displaystyle\sum_{(a_{1},a_{2},\ldots,a_{10})\in S} a_{10}.
\end{align*}
