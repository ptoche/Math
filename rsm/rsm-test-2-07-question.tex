Christina wanted to draw a regular triangle $ABC$. But, since she drew inaccurately, she ended up with a triangle with $m{\angle}A=59\degree$ and $m{\angle}B=58.5\degree$. Then Christina drew the heights $CE$ and $BD$, but since the triangular ruler was slightly skewed, she got $m{\angle}ADB=m{\angle}AEC=91\degree$. Find the degree measure of $m\angle{AED}$.
