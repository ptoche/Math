A polynomial whose roots are all equal to each other is called a unicorn. Compute the number of distinct ordered triples $(M,P,G)$, where $M$, $P$, $G$ are complex numbers such that the polynomials 
\begin{align*}
z^{3} + M z^{2} + P z + G \quad \text{and} \quad z^{3} + G z^{2} + P z + M
\end{align*}
are both unicorns.
