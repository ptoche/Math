The centers of the three circles $A$, $B$, and $C$ are collinear with the center of circle $B$ lying between the centers of circles $A$ and $C$. Circles $A$ and $C$ are both externally tangent to circle $B$, and the three circles share a common tangent line. Given that circle $A$ has radius $12$ and circle $B$ has radius $42$, find the radius of circle $C$.
