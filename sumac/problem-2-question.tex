Form a set of positive integers $S$ by seeding $S$ with two positive integers $a$ and $b$ such that $a \ne b$. Then if $x$ and $y$ are in $S$ where $x \ne y$, and $g$ is the greatest common divisor of $x$ and $y$, include z in S where
$$
z = \frac{x}{g}
$$

For example if we start with $a = 6$ and $b = 10$, then $8$ is also in $S$ since $\gcd(6, 10) = 2$, where $\gcd(6, 10)$ is the greatest common divisor of $4$ and $6$, and
$$
8 = 3 + 5 = \frac{6}{2} + \frac{10}{2}
$$
\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that with seeds $6$ and $10$, the set $S$ is infinite.
\item Is it possible to seed $S$ with distinct positive integers $a$ and $b$ such that $S$ is a finite set?
\end{enumerate}
