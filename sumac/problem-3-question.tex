Consider the following puzzle. Five coins labeled $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and $E$ are arranged around two triangles as follows:

\end{figure}

There are two allowable moves that can be applied repeatedly in any order:

\begin{itemize}
\item Move $X$: you can rotate the three coins on the triangle on the left $120\degree$ clockwise around the center of the triangle on the left.
\item Move $Y$: you can rotate the three coins on the triangle on the right $120\degree$ clockwise around the center of the triangle on the right.

\end{figure}

\end{itemize}

For example, one application of move $X$ from the starting position results in
Then one application of move $Y$ to the above results in

For each of the following, show that the given configuration can be obtained with a combination of moves $X$ and $Y$, or prove no combination of moves $X$ and $Y$ lead to the given configuration:
