The question does not state who splits the integers into two groups: If the split is engineered to maximize $M$, the answer is $M=1012$. If the split is engineered to minimize $M$, the answer is $M=2$. By another interpretation, the answer is $M=14$ or $M=15$, as shown below.

\subsubsection*{General Considerations}

The Fibonacci numbers $F_{0},F_{1},F_{2},\ldots$ are defined inductively, for $n \ge 1$, by 
\begin{align*}
F_{0} & = 0, \\
F_{1} & = 1, \\ 
F_{n+1} & = F_{n} + F_{n-1}.
\end{align*}
The first few terms of the Fibonacci sequence are:
\begin{align*}
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597.
\end{align*}
where $F_{17}=1597$.

Clearly, the largest possible difference $|a_{k+1}-a_{k}|$, calculated from consecutive terms in any subsequence $a_{1},a_{2},\ldots,a_{m}$, cannot exceed $1597$, since $m<2024$, and likewise for $b_{1},b_{2},\ldots,b_{n}$. But $F_{17}=1597$ is unreachable if the subsequences are split into $1012$ elements each. 

The question does not explicitly state a constraint on the Fibonacci numbers, but there may be an implicit understanding that they must form an increasing sequence. We consider several interpretations. 

\subsubsection*{Amicable Split}

Consider the arithmetic sequence with first term $1$ and common difference $F_{1}$. Split the integers as
\begin{align*}
& \text{Group A}: 
\quad
a_{1},a_{2},a_{3}\ldots,a_{1012}
&& = 1,2,3\ldots,1012
\\
& \text{Group B}: 
\quad
b_{1},b_{2},b_{3}\ldots,b_{1012}
&& = 1013,1014,1015\ldots,2024
\end{align*}
where $m=n=1012$.
The difference between any two consecutive elements in the sequence $a_{1},a_{2},a_{3}\ldots,a_{1012}$ is the Fibonacci number $F_{1}$. Likewise for $b_{1},b_{2},b_{3}\ldots,b_{1012}$. Every consecutive element from either Group A or Group B is a fibtastic sequence. The stated conditions are therefore satisfied and the maximum (max-max) is $M=1012$.

\subsubsection*{Adversarial Split}
If $m$ and $n$ are chosen to minimize $M$, we must have $m\ge2$ and $n\ge2$ to ensure that the difference between any two consecutive numbers is defined. An adversarial split that minimizes $M$ is:
\begin{align*}
& \text{Group A}: 
\quad
a_{1}, a_{2}
&& = 1, 2
\\
& \text{Group B}: 
\quad
b_{1},b_{2},b_{3}\ldots,b_{2022}
&& = 3,4,5\ldots,2024
\end{align*}
These sequences are fibtastic, as shown above. The stated conditions are therefore satisfied and the maximum (max-min) is $M=2$. 

\subsubsection*{Increasing Fibonacci Numbers}
Consider the revised definition:
A sequence of integers $x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{k}$ is called \textit{increasing fibtastic} if the difference between any two consecutive elements in the sequence is a Fibonacci number \textbf{\textit{and if these Fibonacci numbers form an increasing sequence}}. Consider both "strictly increasing" and "monotonically increasing" fibtastic sequences. 

The best we found is:
\begin{itemize}[label=-]
\item strictly increasing fibtastic sequence: $M=14$.
\item monotonically increasing fibtastic sequence: $M=15$.
\end{itemize}

Method of construction:
\begin{itemize}
\item Construct a fibtastic sequence of length $n$ starting from $3$ (strict) or $2$ (not strict), that will be used for $(a)_{k}$.
\item Construct another fibtastic sequence of length $n$ starting after the $n$th term of the fibtastic sequence created for $(a)_{k}$.
\item For each fibtastic sequence, place all the integers that fall in the "gaps" into the other subsequence. 
\item Any integer greater or lower than the fibtastic sequences can be placed into any one of the subsequences.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Solution for "strictly increasing" fibtastic sequence:}
$M=14$: The terms in red form a strictly increasing fibtastic sequence. The terms in blue could be moved from subsequence $(b)_{k}$ to subsequence $(a)_{k}$ without altering the solution. 
\begin{align*}
(a)_{k} 
& = \textcolor{red}{3, 4, 6, 9, 14, 22, 35, 56, 90, 145, 234, 378, 611, 988},
\\ 
& \quad\
993, 995, 996, \ldots, 1973, 1974, 1975.
\\[1ex] 
(b)_{k} 
& = \textcolor{blue}{1, 2}, 
5, 7, 8, 10, 11, \ldots, 985, 986, 987,
\textcolor{blue}{989, 990}, 
\\
& \quad\
\textcolor{red}{991, 992, 994, 997, 1002, 1010, 1023, 1044, 1078, 1133, 1222, 1366, 1599, 1976}, 
\\
& \quad\
\textcolor{blue}{1977, 1978, 1979, 1980, 1981, \ldots, 2022, 2023, 2024}.
\end{align*}
The difference between consecutive terms in the fibtastic sequence is:
\begin{align*}
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377
\end{align*}
The difference sequence is the same for $(a)_{k}$ and $(b)_{k}$. It is strictly increasing. 

\subsubsection*{Solution for "monotonically increasing" fibtastic sequence:}
$M=15$: The terms in red form a monotonically increasing fibtastic sequence. The terms in blue could be moved from subsequence $(b)_{k}$ to subsequence $(a)_{k}$ without altering the solution. 
\begin{align*}
(a)_{k} 
& = \textcolor{red}{2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 14, 22, 35, 56, 90, 145, 234, 378, 611, 988},
\\ 
& \quad\
993, 995, 996, \ldots, 1973, 1974, 1975.
\\[1ex] 
(b)_{k} 
& = \textcolor{blue}{1}, 
5, 7, 8, 10, 11, \ldots, 985, 986, 987,
\textcolor{blue}{989, 990}, 
\\
& \quad\
\textcolor{red}{990, 991, 992, 994, 997, 1002, 1010, 1023, 1044, 1078, 1133, 1222, 1366, 1599, 1976}, 
\\
& \quad\
\textcolor{blue}{1977, 1978, 1979, 1980, 1981, \ldots, 2022, 2023, 2024}.
\end{align*}
The difference between consecutive terms in the fibtastic sequence is:
\begin{align*}
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377
\end{align*}
The difference sequence is the same for $(a)_{k}$ and $(b)_{k}$. It is monotonically increasing. 

The next Fibonacci number after $F_{14}=377$ is $F_{15}=610$. Since $1976+610>2024$, it is not possible to insert $F_{15}$.
