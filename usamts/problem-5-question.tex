Let $f(x)=x^{2}+bx+$1 for some real number $b$. Across all possible values of $b$, find all possible values for the number of integers $x$ that satisfy $f(f(x)+x)<0$.

That is, if there are some values of $b$ that give us $180$ integer solutions for x and there are other values of $b$ that give us $314$ integer solutions for $x$ (and these are the only possibilities), the answer would be $\fbox{180,~314}$.
