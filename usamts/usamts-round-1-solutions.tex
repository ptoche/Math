%% As explained there, you will want to uncomment the line below.  But be

%% IMPORTANT
%% If your username contains one of the following characters:
%%      # $ ~ _ ^ % { } &

%% All solutions go in between the \begin{solution} and
%% the \end{solution} corresponding to the problem
%% number.  
%%
%% For example, suppose Problem 2 is 
%% "Solve for x: x + 3 = 5".
%% Your solution would look like this:
%%
%% \begin{solution}{2}
%% If $x+3=5$, then subtract 3 from both
%% sides of the equation to get $x=5-3=2$, so the 
%% solution is $x=2$.
%% \end{solution}
