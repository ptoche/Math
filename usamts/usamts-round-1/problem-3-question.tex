A sequence of integers $x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{k}$ is called \textit{fibtastic} if the difference between any two consecutive elements in the sequence is a Fibonacci number.

The integers from $1$ to $2024$ are split into two groups, each written in increasing order. Group $A$ is $a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{m}$ and Group $B$ is $b_{1},b_{2},...,b_{n}$.

Find the largest integer $M$ such that we can guarantee that we can pick $M$ consecutive elements from either Group $A$ or Group $B$ which form a fibtastic sequence.

%As an illustrative example, if a group of numbers is $2,4,11,12,13,16,18,27,29,30$, the longest fibtastic sequence is $11, 12, 13, 16, 18$, which has length $5$.
