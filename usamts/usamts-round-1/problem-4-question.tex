During a lecture, each of $26$ mathematicians falls asleep exactly once, and stays asleep for a nonzero amount of time. Each mathematician is awake at the moment the lecture starts, and the moment the lecture finishes. Prove that there are either $6$ mathematicians such that no two are asleep at the same time, or $6$ mathematicians such that there is some point in time during which all $6$ are asleep.

%\textbf{Note:} We consider a mathematician to be asleep at the moment they fall asleep, and awake at the moment they wake up.
