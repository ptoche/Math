Fill each cell with an integer from $1-7$ so each number appears exactly once in each row and column. In each "cage" of three cells, the three numbers must be valid lengths for the sides of a non-degenerate triangle. Additionally, if a cage has an "A", the triangle must be acute, and if the cage has an "R", the triangle must be right.

There is a unique solution, but you do not need to prove that your answer is the only one possible. You merely need to find an answer that satisfies the conditions of the problem. (Note: In any other USAMTS problem, you need to provide a full proof. Only in this problem is an answer without justification acceptable.)
