The problem was solved by trial and error. The squares marked $R$ are filled with the Pythagorean triple $(3,4,5)$. The squares marked $A$ are filled with the acute triangles $(3,7,7)$, $(4,5,6)$, and $(4,6,7)$. The other cages include acute and obtuse triangles. There are three iscosceles triangles, $(1,2,2)$ (which appears twice), $(1,6,6)$, and $(3,7,7)$.
