In how many ways can a $3 \times 3$ grid be filled with integers from $1$ to $12$ such that all three of the following conditions are satisfied: (a) both $1$ and $2$ appear in the grid, (b) the grid contains at most $8$ distinct values, and (c) the sums of the numbers in each row, each column, and both main diagonals are all the same? Rotations and reflections are considered the same.
