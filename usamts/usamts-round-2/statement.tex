\subsubsection*{Problem~1}
I used trial and error to find the solution.

\subsubsection*{Problem~2}
I used ideas described on the Wikipedia page
\newline 
\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_square}. 

\subsubsection*{Problem~3}
I did not find similar geometry problems to guide me and followed an analytical approach based on a Cartesian coordinate system. The resulting proofs were more complicated than expected. 

\subsubsection*{Problem~4}
Without \cite{aops:1983}, I would not have known where to start.

\subsubsection*{Problem~5}
Without \cite{j23:2013}, I would not have known where to start.
