Shade some squares in the grid so that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Squares with numbers are unshaded.
\item Each number is equal to the product of the number of unshaded squares it can "see" in its row and column. (A square can see another square if they're in the same row or column and the sight line between them doesn't have any shaded squares. Each square can see itself.)
\item The shaded squares must make one connected group. Two squares are considered to be connected if they share an edge.
\end{enumerate}

The following is an example of a completed puzzle to clarify the rules.

There is a unique solution, but you do not need to prove that your answer is the only one possible. You merely need to find an answer that satisfies the conditions of the problem. (Note: In any other USAMTS problem, you need to provide a full proof. Only in this problem is an answer without justification acceptable.)
