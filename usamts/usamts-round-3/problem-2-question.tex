Calamitous Clod deceives the math beasts by changing a clock at Beast Academy. First, he removes both the minute and hour hands, then places each of them back in a random position, chosen uniformly along the circle. Professor Grok notices that the clock is not displaying a valid time. That is, the hour and minute hands are pointing in an orientation that a real clock would never display. One such example is the hour hand pointed at $6$ and the minute hand pointed at $3$.

The math beasts can fix this, though. They can turn both hands by the same number of degrees clockwise. On average, what is the minimal number of degrees they must turn the hands so that they display a valid time?\footnote[2]{Assume that after Calamitous Clod replaces the hands, they don't move again until the math beasts adjust their position.}.
