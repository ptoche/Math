Let $a$, $b$ be positive integers such that $a^{2} \ge b$. Let
\begin{align*}
x = \sqrt{a + \sqrt{b}} - \sqrt{a - \sqrt{b}}
\end{align*}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Prove that for all integers $a \ge 2$, there exists a positive integer $b$ such that $x$ is also a positive integer.
\item Prove that for all sufficiently large $a$, there are at least two $b$ such that $x$ is a positive integer. 
\end{enumerate}
